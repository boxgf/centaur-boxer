# grid-search

Compling and running main.cpp generates random grids where the agent searches for a path. 
After executing this path the agent shoulfd have visited every node atleast as close as 1 tile away. (this can be changed though)

This is done so that ultrasonic sensor of the robot has high accuracy over grid tiles of 1 ft in length.
